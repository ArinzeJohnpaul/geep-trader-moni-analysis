# Impact Analysis of a Government Micro-Loan Scheme (A GEEP TraderMoni Case Study)

## Project Overview
This data analysis project simulates the evaluation of a public sector micro-loan program, similar to Nigeria's GEEP TraderMoni scheme. The goal is to assess the program's effectiveness based on key performance indicators (KPIs) like **loan repayment rate** and **impact on beneficiaries' daily income**.

**Disclaimer:** This project uses a **mock dataset** created for illustrative purposes to demonstrate data analysis skills. In a real-world scenario, this analysis would be performed on official government data.

## Key Questions Answered
- What is the overall loan repayment rate, indicating the scheme's financial sustainability?
- What is the average increase in the daily income of beneficiaries?
- Which business sectors (e.g., Retail, Agriculture) showed the most significant impact?
- How did the performance vary by demographic factors like gender?
